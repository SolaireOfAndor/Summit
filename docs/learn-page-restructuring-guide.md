# Learn Page Restructuring Project Guide

## Project Overview

**Problem**: Large, information-heavy learn pages (1,000+ lines) causing poor SEO performance, slow loading, and overwhelming UX.

**Solution**: Implement hub-and-spoke model - convert massive pages into streamlined hub pages that link to focused detailed topic pages.

**Goals**:
- Improve SEO through focused keyword targeting
- Enhance performance (faster page loads)
- Better UX with progressive disclosure
- Maintain existing navigation structure (zero impact)

## Implementation Pattern

### Hub Page Structure (~400-500 lines)
- Overview and key benefits
- Quick stats/highlights  
- Topic navigation cards (6-8 detailed pages)
- Design category/type overviews
- Quick start pathways
- CTA sections

### Detailed Pages Structure (~300-400 lines each)
- Comprehensive coverage of specific topic
- SEO-optimized for targeted keywords
- Cross-linking to related topics
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Related topics navigation section
- Consistent design language

### Navigation Strategy
- **Zero impact** on existing nav menus
- Hub page maintains same URL (`/learn/about-sda`)
- Detailed pages use nested URLs (`/learn/about-sda/eligibility-requirements`)
- Progressive disclosure - users choose depth level

## Completed: SDA Restructuring ✅

### Before
- **Single page**: 1,486 lines covering all SDA topics
- **Poor SEO**: Keyword dilution across massive content
- **Bad UX**: Information overload, slow mobile loading

### After
- **Hub page**: 510 lines with navigation to focused topics
- **6 detailed pages**: Each 300-400 lines, SEO-optimized
- **65% size reduction** on main page
- **7x more targeted pages** for search engines

### SDA Pages Created
1. **Hub**: `/learn/about-sda` (510 lines)
2. **Eligibility**: `/learn/about-sda/eligibility-requirements` (350 lines)
3. **Design Categories**: `/learn/about-sda/design-categories-explained` (400 lines)  
4. **Funding**: `/learn/about-sda/funding-and-costs` (380 lines)
5. **Application**: `/learn/about-sda/application-process` (420 lines)
6. **Housing Selection**: `/learn/about-sda/housing-selection-guide` (390 lines)
7. **Rights**: `/learn/about-sda/rights-and-support` (360 lines)

### SEO Improvements
- **Focused keywords** per page vs diluted content
- **Better ranking potential** for specific queries
- **More entry points** from search engines
- **Internal linking** structure established

## Completed: NDIS Funding Restructuring ✅

### Before
- **Single page**: 1,269 lines covering all NDIS funding topics
- **Information overload**: Massive content covering budget categories, plan management, strategies
- **Poor mobile performance**: Slow loading due to page size
- **SEO dilution**: All funding topics competing for same keywords

### After
- **Hub page**: 450 lines with streamlined overview and navigation
- **6 detailed pages**: Each 250-350 lines, topic-focused
- **65% size reduction** on main funding page

### NDIS Funding Pages Created
1. **Hub**: `/learn/funding` (450 lines)
2. **Budget Categories**: `/learn/funding/budget-categories` (350 lines)
3. **Core Support Guide**: `/learn/funding/core-support-guide` (300 lines)
4. **Capital Support**: `/learn/funding/capital-support` (280 lines)
5. **Capacity Building**: `/learn/funding/capacity-building` (300 lines)
6. **Plan Management**: `/learn/funding/plan-management` (250 lines)
7. **Budget Maximization**: `/learn/funding/budget-maximization` (280 lines)

### SEO & Performance Improvements
- **Targeted keywords**: Each page optimizes for specific funding-related searches
- **Better user experience**: Progressive disclosure allows users to choose depth
- **Improved mobile performance**: Significantly faster loading times
- **Enhanced internal linking**: Strong cross-linking between related topics
- **More search entry points**: 7 focused pages vs 1 massive page

## Next Targets

### Priority 1: Other Learn Pages Assessment
- **Status**: Ready for evaluation
- **Next steps**:
  - `/learn/about-sil` - Check current size and complexity  
  - `/learn/about-sta` - Check current size and complexity
  - `/learn/about-mta` - Check current size and complexity

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Page length** > 800 lines = candidate for restructuring
- **Multiple topics** covered = potential for splitting
- **High complexity** = benefits from progressive disclosure
- **Important keywords** = opportunity for focused SEO

## Technical Implementation

### Component Patterns
- **PageHero**: Consistent hero sections with breadcrumbs
- **Topic Cards**: Navigation cards linking to detailed pages
- **Section Navigation**: Back/Next buttons between related pages
- **Related Topics**: Cross-linking at page bottom
- **Consistent Styling**: Using established color palette and spacing
