## Phase 2: Content Re-Engineering — The "SIL-First" Pivot

### 2A. Optimised Meta Tags (All Pages)

- **Description:** `Summit is a registered NDIS SIL provider delivering 24/7 Supported Independent Living across Sydney & NSW. Specialising in ABI, spinal cord injury & high-intensity care. Participant-first approach — we find the right home and support for you.`

#### SIL Service Page (`/supported-accommodations/sil`)
- **Title:** `Supported Independent Living (SIL) Sydney | 24/7 NDIS Care — Summit`
- **Description:** `Summit delivers personalised Supported Independent Living (SIL) with 24/7 rostered care across Sydney & NSW. Specialising in ABI, spinal cord injury, physical disability & psychosocial support. NDIS registered provider — your goals, your home, our support.`

### 2B. Internal Linking Strategy

**Goal:** Pass authority from existing high-ranking SDA pages to SIL service pages.

**Strategy 1: SDA-to-SIL Cross-Links**
Every SDA page should include a contextual link to SIL with anchor text like:
- "While SDA provides the housing, **Supported Independent Living (SIL)** provides the daily support — [learn about our SIL services](/supported-accommodations/sil)"
- "Looking for support services rather than housing? [Explore SIL →](/supported-accommodations/sil)"

**Strategy 2: Hub-and-Spoke Model**
```
/supported-accommodations/sil (PILLAR)
    ├── /properties/sil-vacancies
    ├── /learn/about-sil
    ├── /learn/about-sil/eligibility   (TO CREATE)
    ├── /learn/about-sil/funding       (TO CREATE)
    ├── /learn/about-sil/choosing-provider (TO CREATE - Blog)
    ├── /sil/eastern-suburbs           (TO CREATE - Location)
    ├── /sil/sydney-cbd                (TO CREATE - Location)
    ├── /sil/parramatta                (TO CREATE - Location)
    └── /sil/manly-northern-beaches    (TO CREATE - Location)
```

**Strategy 3: Breadcrumb Link Equity**
Ensure every SIL sub-page includes breadcrumbs linking back to the SIL pillar:
`Home > Supported Independent Living (SIL) > [Sub Page]`

**Strategy 4: Footer "Quick Links"**
Add a prominent SIL section in the footer with links to:
- SIL Services
- SIL Vacancies
- What is SIL?
- SIL Locations

## Phase 3: Local SEO Strategy

### 3A. Location Landing Page Template

Each location page follows this structure (see implementation in `/app/sil/[location]/page.tsx`):

1. **H1:** `SIL Provider [Suburb/Area] — Supported Independent Living | Summit`
2. **Hero paragraph** with location-specific content, mentioning nearby landmarks and transport
3. **"Our SIL Services in [Area]"** section — what Summit offers locally
4. **Specialist Support** — ABI, spinal cord injury, mental health, etc.
5. **"Why Choose Summit in [Area]"** — local trust signals
6. **Current vacancies CTA** — link to filtered vacancy page
7. **FAQ section** — location-specific FAQs (drives FAQ schema)
8. **Contact CTA** — location-specific phone/email

### 3B. Google Business Profile Optimisation

**Step 1: Create the GBP Listing**
- **Business Name:** Summit — Supported Independent Living

- **Secondary Categories:** NDIS Provider, Home Care Service, Disability Care
- **Description:** "Summit is a registered NDIS Supported Independent Living (SIL) provider delivering 24/7 personalised care across Sydney & NSW. We specialise in ABI, spinal cord injury, physical disability & psychosocial support. Our participant-first approach means we find the right home and support team for you — not the other way around."

**Step 2: Optimise for SIL Searches**

- Add all specialty areas as services (ABI support, spinal cord injury care, etc.)
- List all service areas (Eastern Suburbs, CBD, Manly, Parramatta, etc.)
- Upload photos of team members and accessible living environments
- Add posts weekly featuring SIL content

**Step 3: Reviews Strategy**

- Ask reviewers to mention "SIL" and their suburb in reviews naturally

**Step 4: GBP Posts Calendar**
Post weekly about:
- New SIL vacancies (with location)
- Educational SIL content
- Team introductions
- Participant success stories (with consent)

### 3C. Directory Listings for Local Backlinks

| 2 | **Housing Hub** | housinghub.org.au | High | Already in progress — ensure SIL is primary |
| 3 | **MyCareSpace** | mycarespace.com.au | High | NDIS provider comparison — high-intent traffic |

## Appendix: Brand Messaging Guide

### The SDA vs SIL Narrative

Every piece of content should reinforce this message:

> "Summit is a specialist Supported Independent Living (SIL) provider. While our website address references SDA, our core expertise is the **support** — not the housing. We deliver personalised 24/7 SIL care across Sydney and NSW, working with participants first to find the right home and the right support team. Whether you live in an SDA property, a standard rental, or your own home, Summit provides the daily support that empowers your independence."

### Key Brand Differentiators to Emphasise
1. **Participant-first model** — We find the right home for you, not the other way around
2. **24/7 rostered care** — Personalised to each participant's Roster of Care
3. **Specialist expertise** — ABI, spinal cord injury, physical disability, psychosocial
4. **Flexibility** — SIL in any suitable property, not limited to our own buildings
5. **Sydney & NSW coverage** — Eastern Suburbs, CBD, Northern Beaches, Parramatta, regional
